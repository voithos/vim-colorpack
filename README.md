vim-colorpack
=============

This is a growing collection of some of my personal favorite colorschemes
for Vim. The plugin adds a `Themes` menu item for graphical Vim
which can be used to easily modify the currently applied theme.

Almost all of these were not made by me. Credit goes to the original authors.
